    "# Day 13: File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Target - Understanding File Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- File handling allows you to read, write, and manipulate files in Python. \n",
    "- Files can be accessed in different modes, such as reading, writing, and appending.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening a File:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the open() function to open a file.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"filename\", \"mode\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modes:\n",
    "- \"r\" – Read mode (default).\n",
    "- \"w\" – Write mode (creates a new file or truncates an existing file).\n",
    "- \"a\" – Append mode (writes data at the end of the file).\n",
    "- \"b\" – Binary mode.\n",
    "- \"x\" – Exclusive creation mode (fails if the file already exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use read(), readline(), or readlines() to read the content of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing to Files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use write() or writelines() to write to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closing a File:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always close a file after performing operations to free up system resources using file.close().\n",
    "\n",
    "## With Statement (Context Manager):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The with statement automatically takes care of opening and closing the file, ensuring proper resource management.\n"
